**John Faber is a seasoned digital strategist, technical sales leader, and former agency executive with over 15 years of experience guiding enterprise clients through complex digital transformations.** As the founder and managing partner of Chapter Three, he built one of the most respected Drupal-focused agencies in North America, leading high-impact projects for organizations like the Judicial Council of California, UCSF, UC Berkeley, the National Association of Realtors, and the City of San Francisco.

John specializes in content architecture, decoupled platforms, and AI-driven web technologies—most notably advancing Next-Drupal, an open-source framework that merges Drupal with Next.js and Vercel. His core strengths lie in enterprise pre-sales strategy, client acquisition, technical solutioning, and stakeholder alignment. He’s also an expert in WCAG accessibility compliance, AI search integrations, and platform modernization initiatives.

With deep roots in open source and a sharp eye on future-facing technologies, John is now focused on translating his experience into a new role—ideally with a company like Vercel or Anthropic—where he can drive enterprise growth, shape go-to-market strategy, and lead transformational client initiatives at scale.
