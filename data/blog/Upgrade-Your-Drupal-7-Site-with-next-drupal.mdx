title: "Avoid a Drupal 9 Migration Headache: Use NEXT-DRUPAL to Upgrade Your Drupal 7 Site"
date: "May 2, 2022"
draft: false
summary: "Chapter Three offers a modern approach for upgrading from Drupal 7: migrate content to Drupal 9 and decouple the front end using Next.js via their Next-Drupal framework. This three-step process involves cleaning and restructuring content, building a performant front end, and hosting the back end and front end separately — with Drupal on a low-cost provider and Next.js on Vercel. The result is a scalable, cost-efficient, and future-ready headless CMS solution."

# Upgrading from Drupal 7 with Next-Drupal

Drupal 7 and PHP’s end-of-life are right around the corner, and many organizations are evaluating their best path forward.

The typical options are:
1. **Lift and shift** to Drupal 9
2. **Lift, shift, and improve** a few things
3. **Rethink and rebuild** from the ground up

Each path typically results in a **complex Drupal 9 site**, burdened by years of legacy code, entangled content types, and front-end bloat.  
At first glance, the upgrade process seems **cost-prohibitive** and possibly not worth it.

## But There’s a Better Way

**Chapter Three** offers a modern alternative:  
Our [Next-Drupal](https://www.next-drupal.org) integration combines the power of **Drupal 9 as a content platform** with a **Next.js decoupled front end** — a true **headless CMS** that delivers the best of both worlds.

---

## NEXT-Drupal: Our Headless CMS Solution

We propose a three-step upgrade strategy using **Next-Drupal**:

---

### Step One: Clean Up Drupal 7 Content

Most Drupal 7 sites are overloaded with:
- Inline HTML inside body fields
- Hardcoded image links
- Legacy content structures

We fix this through automated migration:

- Strip out inline HTML and WYSIWYG clutter
- Move images into the **Media module**
- Migrate files cleanly into Drupal 9
- Reduce unnecessary module dependencies

The result: a **lean Drupal 9 installation** that’s JSON-ready for your Next.js front end.

---

### Step Two: Build a Modern Front End

Using **Next.js**, we construct a new front-end with:

- Static, performant page-building components (HTML, JavaScript, CSS)
- Real-time collaboration between marketers, designers, and developers
- API-based workflows that pull content and design components directly into the site

> “This is the new way to work.”

---

### Step Three: Host Smart, Scale Efficiently

Yes, decoupling means two hosting environments — but that’s a good thing.

- **Drupal** handles editor access and API calls only, so it can run on a **low-cost host**
- **Vercel** serves the fast, React-based front-end

**Why Vercel?**

- Hosting starts at ~$20/month with 1 TB of data transfer
- Pricing is based on **bandwidth**, not **page views**
- Traffic spikes won’t wreck your budget
- No need for high-performance Drupal hosting infrastructure

## Let’s Recap

✅ Sanitize and restructure your Drupal 7 content  
✅ Rebuild on a clean, component-based **Next-Drupal** platform  
✅ Host front-end on **Vercel** and back-end Drupal on a budget provider

> **Drupal is a fantastic content platform. Next.js and Vercel are the ultimate front-end stack. They belong together.**
