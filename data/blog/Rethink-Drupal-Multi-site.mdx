# Multisite Management with Next-Drupal

**Drupal multisite** is a long-standing method for hosting many sites from a single Drupal installation. While it solved early challenges, it also introduced complexity — and the question of how best to manage multiple Drupal sites remains a hot topic in the community.

**Chapter Three has found a better way.**

---

## The Power of Decoupling

Modern decoupled solutions like **Next.js** provide a powerful alternative to Drupal's traditional front-end. When paired with Drupal as a **pure content platform**, the architecture becomes cleaner, faster, and easier to maintain.

Drupal excels at:
- Building flexible content type architectures
- Managing users, roles, and permissions
- Structuring information through taxonomy

Thanks to the **JSON:API**, all of this is available to a front-end — no need for Drupal’s complex rendering engine.

## Introducing: Next-Drupal Multisite

Chapter Three’s [Next-Drupal](https://next-drupal.org) integration enables **true decoupled multisite** functionality.

> Editors can create and manage content for multiple **Next.js-powered front ends**, all from **one Drupal installation**.

You can build and deploy as many static or dynamic Next.js sites as you need — all sourcing content from a centralized Drupal backend.

---

## Key Advantages

With **Next-Drupal**, you can:

- Push content from a single Drupal CMS to multiple front-end sites
- Replace traditional monolithic multisite structures with lightweight HTML/CSS/JS deployments
- Host each front end on modern providers like **Vercel** or **Netlify**

Developers gain:
- Shared codebases
- Reusable components
- Unified design tokens
- Modern workflows using tools like **Pattern Lab**

Content editors gain:
- Centralized control
- Site-specific previews
- Streamlined editorial experiences

> **One Drupal. Many sites. Fully decoupled. Fully modern.**

## One Instance, Efficient Management

Instead of spinning up dozens of separate Drupal installations, manage everything from one.

Here’s how:

1. Define a content strategy across your organization
2. Identify content structure and relationships
3. Create shared or hybrid taxonomy systems
4. Build a **unified content architecture** with reusable content types
5. Design the front end using a **pattern library**
6. Configure Drupal and host with your chosen provider
7. Deploy each site using **Next.js + Vercel or Netlify**
8. Enjoy seamless multisite control with a single CMS
