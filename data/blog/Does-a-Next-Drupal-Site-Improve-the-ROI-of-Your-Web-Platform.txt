# Why Decoupling with Next-Drupal Delivers Real ROI

Chapter Three introduced **Next-Drupal** three years ago, and it quickly gained popularity.  
This innovative solution offers a robust technical path to **decouple your Drupal site** without sacrificing the daily features editors rely on.

While Next-Drupal has numerous benefits, many decision-makers still question:

> _“Why should I use a decoupled front-end when Drupal works fine?”_

In this post, we explore a compelling reason to consider decoupling your Drupal site — with a specific focus on the **significant return on investment (ROI)** it can yield.

In today’s fiercely competitive market, the value a website brings to a business is under intense scrutiny.  
With AI consuming budgets traditionally allocated for websites, organizations are actively seeking ways to **reduce costs** and **enhance ROI**.  
Decoupling with **Next-Drupal** is a strategic move in that direction.

## The Cost of a Traditional Drupal Setup

Managing a large Drupal site can be a significant financial commitment.  
Key cost drivers include:

- Specialized hosting platforms
- Skilled Drupal developers
- Complex maintenance and scaling issues

Adopting **Next-Drupal** reduces your reliance on all three.

> By decoupling, you lower your financial commitment and free up resources for higher-value business priorities.

## Why LAMP + TWIG Struggles at Scale

Traditional Drupal hosting often runs on a **LAMP stack**, which:

- Works well for small to medium traffic
- Becomes difficult and expensive to scale for high traffic
- Requires rendering TWIG templates server-side, adding resource strain

Managed Drupal platforms emerged to address this, but their cost has grown exponentially with project ambition and complexity.

## The Next-Drupal Architecture

Next-Drupal separates the **backend (Drupal)** from the **frontend (Next.js)**, leveraging:

- Drupal's API-first content modeling
- Next.js's fast, React-based rendering

This architecture allows for:

- More efficient scaling
- Less expensive hosting
- Streamlined developer workflows

## A Real-World ROI: From Drupal 7 to 10

One recent project upgraded a high-traffic site from Drupal 7 to Drupal 10 using Next-Drupal.

**Key facts:**

- Previously hosted on a complex internal infrastructure
- Required multiple servers for reliability and traffic load
- Ongoing IT maintenance and hardware overhead

**The result after moving to a composable platform:**

- Internal servers eliminated
- Drupal server load drastically reduced
- Only one server needed for editorial tasks
- Vercel now serves the front end
- **Hosting costs reduced by 65%**

> No more “page-view” bills — just fast, scalable delivery using bandwidth-based pricing.

## Composable Hosting is the Future

Next-Drupal unlocks the potential of a **composable architecture**, where:

- Each piece of the tech stack does what it does best
- Infrastructure is elastic and cost-effective
- Your team can focus on content and experience, not DevOps
