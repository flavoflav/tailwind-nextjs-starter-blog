# Why Vercel is the Ideal Front-End Host for Next-Drupal

There’s a lot to be said for going decoupled with your website.  
From speed and scalability to increased security and front-end flexibility, **headlessness solves many common website shortcomings**.  
And **Drupal**, as an **API-first platform**, is a perfect fit for this headless revolution.

That said, going headless introduces new **complexities**, particularly around **hosting**.  
With a traditional CMS, one host is enough. But with a decoupled architecture, you typically need **two hosting providers**: one for the **back end (Drupal)** and one for the **front end (Next.js)**.

## The Hosting Challenge

Major hosting providers have adapted, offering bundled solutions for both ends of headless sites.  
These solutions simplify billing and centralize service. However, they often come with **limitations**, especially for **Next-Drupal front ends**.  
In contrast, **Vercel** offers a tailored, high-performance platform purpose-built for **Next.js** — and by extension, **Next-Drupal**.

---

## Why Vercel?

Vercel was founded by the **creator of Next.js**, and its infrastructure is built around the unique needs of the Next.js ecosystem.  
That makes it an ideal match for **Next-Drupal**, a version of Next.js optimized specifically for Drupal integrations.

### Key Benefits of Vercel Hosting:

- ⚡ **Developer Speed**  
  Push front-end changes to GitHub and Vercel **auto-builds instantly** — changes appear within seconds, unlike other platforms where updates may take 30+ minutes.

- 🔍 **Performance Insights**  
  Built-in speed reports similar to **Google Lighthouse**, providing real-world user experience data.

- 🧩 **Powerful Integrations**  
  Integrates seamlessly with third-party tools like **Shopify**, **Slack**, and multiple logging providers.

- 🔁 **Preview Environments**  
  Preview builds are fast and easy to share — clients can view and **comment directly on staging URLs**, accelerating feedback loops.

> While Vercel does not host the Drupal back end, it is **unmatched as a front-end hosting platform** for modern decoupled sites.
